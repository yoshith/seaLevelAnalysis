The data used in this study were obtained programmatically via the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) APIs. 
Specifically, tide and current observations were retrieved from NOAA’s Tides & Currents data services for all available stations.

The dataset includes station-level water level measurements and associated metadata as provided by NOAA. 
Data were accessed through automated API queries to ensure consistency and reproducibility across stations.

Due to size considerations, the raw data files are not stored in this repository. 
Instead, the notebooks and scripts included here demonstrate how to retrieve the data directly from NOAA’s official services.
